üß≠ Additional Feature: Ultrasonic Distance Measurement
This part of the project measures distance using an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and prints the result to the Serial Monitor.

#define TRIG_PIN D5

digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(2);
digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(10);
digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);

duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH);
distance = (duration * 0.0343) / 2;
The trigger pin sends a 10¬µs pulse.

The echo pin receives the reflected pulse and calculates the duration.

Distance is calculated using the speed of sound.

üñ•Ô∏è Output
Check the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (9600 baud) to view real-time distance in centimeters.
